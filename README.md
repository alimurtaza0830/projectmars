This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

To install the dependencies

### `npm start`

To see it running.

### `Note`

>> for some reasons my `json-server` wasn't running, so i didn't mock the api, instead got the data from the variable.
